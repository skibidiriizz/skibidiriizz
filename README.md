### 👋 Hi, I’m @skibidiriizz

- 👀 I’m interested in LLMs (Large Language Models), AI agents, and building end-to-end intelligent systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about LLM architectures, agent frameworks, and how to deploy fully functional AI applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to AI education, autonomous agents, and developer tools powered by LLMs.
